\begin{itemize}
    \item Use new lattice encoding to improve key exchange protocols' efficiency.
    \item Distributed Broadcast Encryption with Ring Signature
    \item MPC YOSO model theoretical lower bound
    \item DSSE TYPE-2
    \item Lattice signature tightness~\cite{PKC:DGJL21} explains why this is difficult in lattice setting. (Extremely Difficult)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The main technical difficulty of tightly secure lattice scheme is basically the RSR only presents for LWE and false for RLWE or MLWE.
        \item This is related to the samples preserving lattice reductions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item More efficient adaptively-secure puncturable pseudorandom functions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \cite{EC:Yang23} gives a construction of adaptively-secure private puncturable pseudorandom function.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Adaptively secure puncturable encryption
    \item Construction of more efficient vector commitment
\end{itemize}
