\section{Chosen-Ciphertext Encryption}

We try to give a list of chosen-ciphertext encryption constructions as exhaustive as possible.


There are two types of generic transform, with or without random oracle model. The transform without random oracle are more desirable, but more complex at the same time.

In the random oracle model, we give the following transforms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fujisaki-Okamoto~\cite{JC:FujOka13} transform
\end{itemize}

In the standard model, there are several different way to construct $\cca$-secure encryption scheme.
\begin{itemize}
    \item BCHK transform~\cite{SIAM:BCHK07}: this transform a selective-ID $\ibe$ into an $\cca$-secure encryption scheme.
    \item Lossy Trapdoor functions~\cite{STOC:PeiWat08}
    \item Naor-Yung transform~\cite{STOC:NaoYun90} 
\end{itemize}
